Here you can find some of the different "practise" projects I've been developing since I started learning to code.  
This is a track of my personal improvement rather than a selection of my best projects. Some of the projects here have a code that could be easily cleaned and improved, but this way I can see the difference from where I started and where I am right now.  
   
## RMarkdown Data Wranpling:      
My very first project. After learning how to code at my MSc in Statistics, I used my knowledge in R creating a simple web for a data wrangpling project:
